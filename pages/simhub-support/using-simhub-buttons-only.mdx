## Using SimHub Buttons when no gamepad support is enabled

When no gamepad support is enabled for your ESP firmware you can still use buttons to trigger certain actions through SimHub.

- Control SimHub features, such as:
    - Change dashboard layouts
    - Increment/decrement values such as redline
    - Control volume
    - Change arduino screen layouts or brightness
    - Switch LED layouts
    - Increase/decrease motion/vibration gains
- Emulate keyboard presses.

## SimHub Button to control SimHub features
- On the sidebar select "Controls and Events"
- Select the "Controls" tab
- Click the "New Mapping" button
- On the new screen, click on the left column text field that says "Type to filter"
- Press the button you want to use on your ESP SimHub device
- A button should appear with a name similar to "AdditionalButtons_2_2"
- On the right column (Target), select the SimHub feature you want to control
- Click "Ok"
