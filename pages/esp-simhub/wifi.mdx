# WiFi Configuration

## Overview
Connecting to your device to SimHub over WiFi is something that's only possible because ESP devices have built in WiFi.
SimHub is fully ignorant of the WiFi connection, it only knows how to connect via a serial port.

On the SimHub computer, we install software that fakes a serial port, and redirects all the data to an ip Address and port.
The ESP device is connected to that ip address and port and knows how to decode the messages and respond to them. The software is only 
responsible for sending and receiving data, it doesn't know anything about the SimHub protocol, or the ESP device.

## Setup
Download ESP-SimHub from the [releases page](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/releases) and [set up platformio](/esp-simhub/getting-started)

Edit [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp) to configure the WiFi connection:

Set the preprocessor directive called CONNECTION_TYPE to WIFI `#define CONNECTION_TYPE WIFI`. Set `DEBUG_BRIDGE` to true as well, and set monitor_speed = 115200 in [platformio.ini](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/platformio.ini)

Either:
- Hardcode your WiFi Credentials in the src/main.cpp and enable `USE_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS`. Use this if you want simpler setup, and won't upload the code anywhere.
- Don't enable `USE_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS`. This will use WiFiManager which creates a WiFi access point that you can connect to with your phone or computer. Then you can visit 192.168.4.1 and you'll enter your wifi credentials there.
  - Warning: We have yet to build a mechanism to reset your saved credentials. Currently you have to [erase the flash memory](https://community.platformio.org/t/how-to-erase-flash/24465/5) through platformio to do so and upload your firmware again.

Upload the firmware to your device.

Open the serial monitor in PlatformIO.

Connect to the WiFi network either through the hardcoded credentials or through the WiFiManager access point.

Once your connected, write down the IP address of the device.

## Serial port redirection
- Download [Perle TruePort](https://www.perle.com/downloads/trueport.shtml). 
- Install it. 
- Configure a new COM port. 
- Forward the data to the IP address of your ESP. 
- [Check the manual on the section called "Configuring the COM Port Connection" > "Access Device Server Serial Port"](https://www.perle.com/downloads/drivers/trueport/windows/windows_ug.pdf) 
- Follow the instructions to set it up in **LITE mode**. .. and that should be it.

## Troubleshooting
Before we get started, Did you remember to set TruePort in LITE mode?

- First and foremost, keep the serial monitor open and check for any errors or reboots.
- Revert enabling any features one by one to isolate the problem.
- Check if your Perle TruePort is configured in **LITE mode**!!!!!!.
- Check if your ESP is connected to the SAME network as SimHub.
- Check if SimHub is scanning the port correctly.
- Check if the IP address of the ESP is correct.
