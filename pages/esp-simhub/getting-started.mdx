# Getting Started with eCrowne ESP-SimHub Firmware

Welcome to the eCrowne ESP-SimHub firmware! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started with creating custom sim racing hardware using <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.ESP8266} /> and <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.ESP32} /> microcontrollers.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This firmware is not supported by SimHub. It's a custom firmware for ESP devices written by eCrowne.
</Callout>

## Forewarning

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you don't have time to code, and maybe debug a thing or two this firmware is not for you. Get an <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.Arduino} /> and use the point and click configurator from SimHub.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This firmware is still under development and not all features are fully implemented.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This firmware doesn't support built-in point and click configurator from SimHub. You need to manually configure [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp) file with code.
</Callout>

- **Some electronics knowledge**: Generic "how do I connect an encoder?" questions are a search on the internet away, but not here.
- **Coding Experience**: Basic understanding of Arduino or C/C++ programming is recommended.
- **Development Environment**: 
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
- **GIT Binaries**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) for installing dependencies and contributing to the project.
- **Hardware**: <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.ESP8266} /> or <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.ESP32} /> development board, USB cable for programming.

## Installation Steps

1. **Set Up Your IDE**:
   - [Install Visual Studio Code and the PlatformIO extension from the VSCode marketplace.](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
   - [More setup guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS-x1qmuTNjaSI9U8lEJeWsmDuZjVs9aJ4cIcMp2I56GylIOKC8hjxeUtdAKORj8nT1Fi5TpgLljDKL/pub)

2. **Clone the Repository or download the zip file**:
   - [Download the latest release zip file](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/releases)
   - Unzip the file into a folder. This will be your working directory (ESP-SimHub).

OR

   - Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the firmware repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd ESP-SimHub
     ```

3. **Open the Project in VSCode**:
   - Launch VSCode and open the `ESP-SimHub` folder.
   - PlatformIO will automatically detect the project configuration.

4. **Configure Your Board**:
   - See the [Board Configuration Guide](/esp-simhub/board-configuration) for detailed instructions on setting up your specific board.

5. **Build and Upload the Firmware**:
   <Image width={600} height={600} src="/platformio/platformio-ide-vscode-build-project.png" alt="PlatformIO Build and Upload" />
   - Connect your ESP device to your computer via USB.
   - Use PlatformIO to build and upload the firmware:
     - Find the bottom bar in VSCode.
     - Select "Build" to compile the code.
     - Select "Upload" to flash the firmware to your device.

## Additional Resources

- **Documentation**: For detailed instructions and configuration options, refer to the [eCrowne Platformio documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS-x1qmuTNjaSI9U8lEJeWsmDuZjVs9aJ4cIcMp2I56GylIOKC8hjxeUtdAKORj8nT1Fi5TpgLljDKL/pub)
