## I2C LCD Configuration

These devices are commonly found as <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.I2CLCD}>16x2 I2C LCD Display</AffiliateLink> and <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.I2CLCD20X4}>20x4 I2C LCD Display</AffiliateLink>. They typically use the PCF8574 or PCF8574AT I2C adapter board which converts parallel LCD interface to I2C.

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect your I2C LCD to the ESP device:
- SDA → GPIO21 (ESP32) or GPIO4/D2 (ESP8266)
- SCL → GPIO22 (ESP32) or GPIO5/D1 (ESP8266)
- VCC → 5V - VIN when connected to USB or external adapter. ESP devices use 3.3V otherwise. Won't work if you're using a battery.
- GND → GND

### Software Configuration

1. Enable the feature near the top of [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp):
```cpp
#define INCLUDE_I2CLCD
```

2. Configure your LCD lower in [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp):
```cpp
#define I2CLCD_size 1         // 0 = 20x4; 1=16x2
#define I2CLCD_ADDRESS 0x27   // or 0x30, 0x3F, etc.
#define I2CLCD_LIBRARY 1      // 0 = PCF8574AT; 1,PCF8574T (Check the chip behind your LCD adapter)
#define I2CLCD_TEST 0         // 0 = disable; 1 = enable showing "hello world" on startup
#define I2CLCD_SDA SDA        // define your i2c SDA pin here, it is set by default to the hardware pin (SDA is a constant that means that but you can use a number for your pin)
#define I2CLCD_SCL SCL        // define your i2c SCL pin here, it is set by default to the hardware pin (SCL is a constant that means that but you can use a number for your pin)
```

<Callout type="warning">
If your LCD doesn't work, you may need to find its I2C address:
1. Use an I2C scanner sketch
2. Common addresses are 0x27 and 0x3F
3. Use I2CLCD_TEST to check if the device is working

### SimHub capabilities
Verify that the Arduino tab shows the device with a feature `I2C LCD: True`.

SimHub will display the text shown in the Arduino -> Screens tab.

By default when a game is not running it displays the current date. 
When a game is running it displays ["Current Lap" "Gear" "Speed"] but you can edit the data, the order, etc in the editor.
