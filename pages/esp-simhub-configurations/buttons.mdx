## Buttons Through SimHub / NO GAMEPAD SUPPORT

For simple <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.Buttons}>button inputs</AffiliateLink>

<Callout type="warning">
These buttons are handled through SimHub and not as a gamepad/controller. So there are many limitations to what you can do with them.
</Callout>

Enable and configure the feature in [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp):

```cpp
#define INCLUDE_BUTTONS

// ...further down

// how many buttons are you using?, max 12
#define ENABLED_BUTTONS_COUNT 1 
#ifdef  INCLUDE_BUTTONS

// which pin to use for the button
#define BUTTON_PIN_1 3

// how is the button wired?, 0 = pin connects to GND, 1 = VCC connects to pin
#define BUTTON_WIRINGMODE_1 0

// what logic should be used?: 0 = normal, 1 = reversed
#define BUTTON_LOGICMODE_1 0

// ... more buttons

```

## How to use buttons

How to use buttons in SimHub can be found in the [Using SimHub Buttons Only](/simhub-support/using-simhub-buttons-only) documentation.

## Common Issues with buttons

- **Button not working**: Make sure your wiring and pin configuration is correct.
- **Device disconnects whe using feature**: Make sure the pins you selected can be used as input or if using them causes resets/crashes.
