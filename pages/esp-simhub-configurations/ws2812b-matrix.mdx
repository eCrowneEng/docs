## WS2812B Matrix

For an <AffiliateLink type={ProductType.NeoMatrix}>RGB LED matrix display</AffiliateLink> (like a 8x8 grid):

Enable and configure the feature in [src/main.cpp](https://github.com/eCrowneEng/ESP-SimHub/blob/main/src/main.cpp):

```cpp
#define INCLUDE_WS2812B_MATRIX

// ...further down

#define WS2812B_MATRIX_ENABLED 1

// which pin to use for the data input
#define WS2812B_MATRIX_DATAPIN 10

// does your hardware use a serpentine layout?
#define WS2812B_MATRIX_SERPENTINELAYOUT 0

// if so, which direction?
#define WS2812B_MATRIX_SERPENTINELAYOUTREVERSE 0

```

## Common Issues with WS2812B matrix

- **Matrix is slow**: We need to port NEOPIXELBUS to support this feature, as currently only BitBang is supported.
- **Flickering or not working**: Make sure you're powering your matrix from the correct external power source.
- **Layout is flipped**: Configure rotation in SimHub.
- **Not sending data**: Some WS2812B LEDs require 5v signal, which the ESPs cannot provide. You'll need a level shifter or try shorter wires.
- **Frame drops / flashes during normal usage**: If you're using BitBang method, you're running out of CPU time to handle other ESP tasks. Try an ESP8266 or wait for NeoPixelBus to support this feature.
